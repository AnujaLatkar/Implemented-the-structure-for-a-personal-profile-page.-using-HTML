1. Image Implementation (<img>)

The <img> tag is an empty element, meaning it doesn't have a closing tag.
src: Specifies the path to the image.
alt: Provides "Alternative Text" if the image fails to load (crucial for accessibility).
Dimensions: Height and width are set in pixels to maintain the layout.


2. Hyperlink (<a>)

The <a> (Anchor) tag creates a clickable link.
The href attribute (Hypertext Reference) defines the destination URL.
The text between the opening and closing tags is what the user actually clicks on.


3. Table Structure (<table>, <tr>, <td>)

Tables are built row by row:
<tr> (Table Row) defines a horizontal row.
<th> (Table Header) defines a bold, centered header cell.
<td> (Table Data) defines a standard cell.


4. Nested Tables

A nested table is simply a table placed inside the <td> or <th> tag of another table. This is
used for complex data layouts where one category (like "Details") needs to be broken down into
further sub-categories (like "Class" and "Division").
